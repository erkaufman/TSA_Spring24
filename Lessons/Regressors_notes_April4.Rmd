how to add regressors to model
```{r}
regressors <- as.matrix(data.frame(fourier(ts_daily_train, K= c(2,12)), "temp"=temp_train))

#fit arima model with fourier terms as exogenous regressors
#seasonal = FALSE is the same as P=D=Q=0

ARIMA_Four_fit_REG <- auto.arima(ts_daily_train, 
seasonal=FALSE,
lambda= 0,
xreg=regressors)
```
